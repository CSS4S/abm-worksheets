## Wrapping Up: Networks and Diffusion

We've now created agents and placed them in structured environments. One important next step is to understand how the structure of a social network affects the spread of information, behaviors, or innovations.

How can we add realism to our social network models? What does "realism" look like? Next lecture we'll expand our theoretical knowledge of social networks, likely followed by another hands-on Worksheet session on Wednesday.

For now, consider this:

> **Which kinds of social networks help spread information bestâ€”and why?**

One classic paper on how network structure might affect diffusion is Watts and Strogatz's 1998 study that creates "long-range ties" that connect agents who would otherwise be socially distant from one another: <https://www.nature.com/articles/30918>. Please have a look at this paper in the next week or so. Here is a preview of small-world networks that start from a *regular lattice* that has each of its edges progressively "rewired" with probability $p$, called the *rewiring probability.* (Hint: copy the "Small-world networks" example from `socmod` documentation in the *random networks* section: <https://css4s.github.io/socmod/#random-networks>)
